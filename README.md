# Soliloquy
Nintendo Entertainment System emulated with rust with a primary focus on
learning.

Versioning and planning: [Project TODO](doc/NES_TODO.org)

## Project Goals
  - Sufficiently emulate most NES Cartridges (on a somewhat useable level).
  - Allow the use of default controller, and some preripherals.
  - Asynchronous GUI, to allow for multi-language implementation (cross platform).
  - Provide a knowledge base for a possible future emulation project.
  
## Personal Goals
  - Actually learn how to write clean readable code.
  - Learning proper unit/integration testing practices.

## Primary References
  - fogleman/nes : A fantastic reference for understanding how to get started, and structure an emulator.
  - pcwalton/sprocketnes : Great for helping me understand how to implement a project like this in rust.

## License
This is just an educational project: I've read a lot of similar implementations, and borrowed many ideas. Hopefully, herein lies some original ideas that are worth sharing.
