Nintendo Entertainment System emulated with rust!

Project Goals:
  Sufficiently emulate most NES Cartridges, on a somewhat useable level.
  Allow the use of ROB, and the default controller (maybe zap gun and power glove?)

This project is gonna borrow heavily from fogleman/nes, but hopefully it's not just a copy paste job!
