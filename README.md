# Soliloquy
Nintendo Entertainment System emulated with rust with a primary focus on
learning.


Project Goals:
  - Sufficiently emulate most NES Cartridges, on a somewhat useable level.
  - Allow the use of ROB, and the default controller (maybe zap gun and power glove?)
  - Asynchronous GUI, to allow for multi-language implementation (cross platform).
  
  
Personal Goals:
  - Actually learn how to write clean readable code.
  - Actually understand what test driven code looks like.


This project is gonna borrow heavily from fogleman/nes, but hopefully it's not just a copy paste job!
Also, pcwalton/sprocketnes has been great for helping me understand how to implement a project like this in rust.
