* Soliloquy
Nintendo Entertainment System emulated with rust with a primary focus on
learning.

Versioning and planning: [[doc/ROADMAP.org][Project TODO]] 

** Project Goals
 - Emulate basic NES games (Donkey Kong, Ice Climbers, etc.)
 - Allow the use of default controller, and some preripherals.
 - Provide a knowledge base for a possible future emulation project.
  
** Philosophy 
The CPU file is over-engineered and over tested for the sake of having a strong core that hopefully won't have to be modified. As I progress outwards from the core, I'm going to attempt a more rapid-development type of approach, rather than the previous, more test-driven methods.


** Roadmap
Even writing a simple NES emulator should take a good while. 
The implementation order should be:
**** DONE CPU
**** TODO CART/mappers
**** TODO APU
**** TODO PPU
**** TODO IO/GUI

** References
  - fogleman/nes : A fantastic reference for getting started.
  - pcwalton/sprocketnes : Great for helping me understand how to implement a project like this in rust.

** License
This is just an educational project: I've read a lot of similar implementations, and borrowed many ideas. Hopefully, herein lies ideas that are worth sharing.
